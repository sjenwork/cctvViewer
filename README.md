# cctvViewer

This html is used to view the images from CCTV.
You can download the html file and use it directly in your browser.

There are two methods to use it:

The first one: 
  1. upload image with the format of file name: *yyyymmdd-hhMMSS.jpg (jpeg or png is permitted.)
  2. in the page of table-like, image will be displayed in table cell.
  3. you can select slide-like mode to view images by tapping mouse or by keyboard.
  4. in slide-like mode, you can give each image a (visibility) level from 1(meaning worst) to 4(meaning best)
  5. after assigning the levels of each image, you can select the heatmap page to view the visualization image.
 
The Second:
  1. directly upload the file with grading (format like the example file: level.txt)
  2. the heatmap diagram will be directly shown in your page.
  3. if you upload the image file after that, when you go back to the slide-like page, you can get the level in the upper left corner.
